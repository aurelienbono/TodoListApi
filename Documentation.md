### Project Overview: Todo List API with FastAPI

#### Project Objective
Create a simple Todo List API using FastAPI to manage tasks. This project will include basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It will help beginners understand how to structure an API, handle requests and responses, and connect to a database.

#### Project Components

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
   - Set up the project structure

2. **Define the API Endpoints**
   - **Create Task**: An endpoint to create a new task.
   - **Read Tasks**: An endpoint to get all tasks.
   - **Read Single Task**: An endpoint to get a specific task by its ID.
   - **Update Task**: An endpoint to update an existing task.
   - **Delete Task**: An endpoint to delete a task by its ID.

3. **Data Model**
   - Define a Pydantic model for the Task schema.
   - Define an SQLAlchemy model to interact with the database.

4. **Database Setup**
   - Choose a database (e.g., SQLite for simplicity).
   - Set up database connection.
   - Create tables using SQLAlchemy.

5. **CRUD Operations Implementation**
   - Implement the logic for each CRUD operation.
   - Handle error cases and validation.

6. **API Documentation**
   - Utilize FastAPI’s automatic documentation generation.
   - Ensure all endpoints are well-documented.

7. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for each endpoint.
   - Use FastAPI's TestClient for testing.

8. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the API using a server like Uvicorn.
   - Optionally, containerize the application using Docker for easier deployment.

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Project Setup
- Initialize a new Python project.
- Set up a virtual environment.
- Install dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy`, `databases`.

#### 2. Define the API Endpoints
- `/tasks` (GET): Retrieve all tasks.
- `/tasks/{task_id}` (GET): Retrieve a single task by its ID.
- `/tasks` (POST): Create a new task.
- `/tasks/{task_id}` (PUT): Update an existing task.
- `/tasks/{task_id}` (DELETE): Delete a task by its ID.

#### 3. Data Model
- Create a `Task` Pydantic model for request and response validation.
- Create a `Task` SQLAlchemy model for the database schema.

#### 4. Database Setup
- Configure the database URL.
- Set up SQLAlchemy models.
- Create the database tables.

#### 5. CRUD Operations Implementation
- Implement each endpoint with the necessary logic.
  - Creating a task: Validate input data and insert it into the database.
  - Reading tasks: Fetch tasks from the database.
  - Updating a task: Validate and update the task data in the database.
  - Deleting a task: Remove the task from the database.

#### 6. API Documentation
- Use FastAPI’s built-in Swagger UI to provide interactive documentation.
- Ensure each endpoint has clear descriptions and example requests/responses.

#### 7. Testing
- Write tests for each API endpoint using FastAPI's TestClient.
- Ensure tests cover all CRUD operations and edge cases.

#### 8. Deployment
- Run the application locally with Uvicorn.
- Optionally, create a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
- Deploy to a cloud provider or any hosting platform that supports Docker or Uvicorn.

### Additional Considerations
- **Authentication**: Add basic authentication if needed.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for the read endpoints if the number of tasks becomes large.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Set up logging for debugging and monitoring.

This project will provide a comprehensive introduction to building and deploying an API with FastAPI, covering all essential aspects from setup to deployment.
